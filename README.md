The idea is to upload some Machine Learning Recipes for:

*Linear Regression*: 
Ordinary Least Squares Regression, Stepwise Regression, Principal Component Regression and Partial Least Squares Regression.

*Penalized-Linear Regression*: Ridge Regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and ElasticNet

*Non-Linear Regression*: Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spines (MARS), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Neural Network.

*Non-Linear Decision Tree Regression*: Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Conditional Decision Trees, Modal Trees, Rule Systems, Bagging CART, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Machines (GBM) and Cubist.

*Linear Classification*: Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis.

*Non-Linear Classification*: Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Regularized Discriminant Analysis (RDA), Neural Network, Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Naive Bayes.

*Non-Linear Decision Tree Classification*: Classification and Regression Trees (CART), C4.5, PART, Bagging CART, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Machines (GBM) and Boosted C5.0.
